Both implementations in `my-markdown-parser` and `markdown-parse` is incorrect. Based on the screenshot above, the expected output is supposed to be `ti*tle` but based on the `vimdiff` comparison, the implementation in the `markdown-parse` shows no output, and the implemenation in the `my-markdown-parser` shows the whole value inside the parentheses.
